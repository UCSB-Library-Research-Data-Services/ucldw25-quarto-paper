Quarto is a publication tool built into the RStudio multilanguage data analysis and visualization platform, often used in conjunction with code notebooks. Quarto enables a more reproducible approach to data-driven research by integrating documentation, code, and results in one document. But itâ€™s also a great publication platform on its own! In this session a panel of Quarto users will showcase what Quarto is capable of, especially when used in concert with GitHub Pages hosting, including creating websites (course websites, personal websites, blogs), presentations, dashboards, academic papers, and books. We will also demonstrate, in real-time, how easy it is to create such research deliverables. Prepare to be sold on using Quarto!
This repository contains a demo using RStudio and Quarto to demonstrate how researchers can take advantage of this scientific publishing mechanism to develop academic papers.
This session was presented at the Panel Quarto Showcase at the UC [Love Data Week 2025](https://uc-love-data-week.github.io/2025/calendar#quarto)
