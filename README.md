## Quarto Showcase: Academic Papers

### About the Repository
This repository contains a demo using **RStudio** and **Quarto** to demonstrate how researchers can take advantage of this scientific publishing mechanism to develop academic papers.
**Quarto** is a publication tool built into the RStudio multilanguage data analysis and visualization platform, often used in conjunction with code notebooks. Quarto enables a more reproducible approach to data-driven research by integrating **documentation**, **code**, and **results** in one document. But itâ€™s also a powerful publication platform on its own!

### Session Details
This session was presented at the **Panel Quarto Showcase** at the UC [Love Data Week 2025](https://uc-love-data-week.github.io/2025/calendar#quarto).
